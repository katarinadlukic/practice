The goal of this test is to create a method of examining a Social Network. 
You are given dataset (data.json) representing a group of people, in the form of a social graph. 
Each person listed has one or more connections to the group.

Use dataset provided and develop a Web app or an API,
 which provides functionality to choose a person within the group stored in the database, 
 and display the following information about this person:

• Direct friends: those people who are directly connected to the chosen user;
• Friends of friends: those who are two steps away from the chosen user, 
  but not directly connected to the chosen user;
• Suggested friends: people in the group who know 2 or more direct friends of the chosen user, 
  but are not directly connected to the chosen user;

General Requirements:
• You can use any software design patterns you think are appropriate for the implementation.
• You can use any programming language, but solutions in JavaScript will have advantage.

Put your completed test on GitHub and send us a link.
This test should be completed by Sunday, September 30th.

Have fun and good luck!
